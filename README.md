# Overview
This is a minimalistic OpenLDAP server running on a ubuntu docker container. 

# Architectures Supported
In theory, this build should support anything that the ubuntu base image supports. 

# Initial Configuration
The initial slapd dpkg configuration, as well as the daemon settings will be entirely configured using environmental variables. Eventually we should have an environmental variable for every option.

You can find a full list of those at the bottom of this page.
